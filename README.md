# TARA-Tracker

<h2> Description </h2>
This app was built by Justin Wei in order to help collect information from subjects in the University of California, San Francisco "Brain Change" study.
The study focuses on the effects of mindfulness practices on the brains of adolescents,
and subjects can use this app to track the amount of time they spend doing YBM, Breathing, and Meditation at home. Through this
app they can also access course materials (password protected). At the end of the program, subjects will be able to submit their minute-logs
via email to the head of the study (also password protected) using this application.
